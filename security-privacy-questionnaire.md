# [Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy](https://w3ctag.github.io/security-questionnaire/)

## 01. What information does this feature expose, and for what purposes?

The COS API exposes the availability of files identified by their hash across different origins. The purpose is to enable efficient sharing of large files (e.g., AI models, SQLite databases, Wasm modules) to reduce redundant downloads and storage.

## 02. Do features in your specification expose the minimum amount of information necessary to implement the intended functionality?

Yes, after explicit user consent, the API exposes only the existence of a file with a known hash and provides read access to it. No additional metadata nor write access is exposed.

## 03. Do the features in your specification expose personal information, personally-identifiable information (PII), or information derived from either?

No.

## 04. How do the features in your specification deal with sensitive information?

Files can only be accessed with explicit user consent. The API does not allow arbitrary file discovery or sharing of sensitive user data without permission.

## 05. Does data exposed by your specification carry related but distinct information that may not be obvious to users?

No.

## 06. Do the features in your specification introduce state that persists across browsing sessions?

Yes. Files stored in COS persist across sessions. However, their access is gated by user consent, and user agents can manage eviction policies to maintain control over this state.

## 07. Do the features in your specification expose information about the underlying platform to origins?

No.

## 08. Does this specification allow an origin to send data to the underlying platform?

No.

## 09. Do features in this specification enable access to device sensors?

No.

## 10. Do features in this specification enable new script execution/loading mechanisms?

No.

## 11. Do features in this specification allow an origin to access other devices?

No.

## 12. Do features in this specification allow an origin some measure of control over a user agent's native UI?

No.

## 13. What temporary identifiers do the features in this specification create or expose to the web?

None.

## 14. How does this specification distinguish between behavior in first-party and third-party contexts?

Explicit user consent is required for cross-origin access.

## 15. How do the features in this specification work in the context of a browserâ€™s Private Browsing or Incognito mode?

Files previously stored in COS are not accessible in Private Browsing or Incognito mode. Browser vendors may allow COS to work during an Incognito session, but the data would not be retained. Alternatively, browser vendors may disable COS entirely.

## 16. Does this specification have both "Security Considerations" and "Privacy Considerations" sections?

Yes. The specification includes detailed sections addressing security and privacy implications, including hashing, user consent, and eviction policies.

## 17. Do features in your specification enable origins to downgrade default security protections?

Yes, upon explicit user consent.

## 18. What happens when a document that uses your feature is kept alive in BFCache?

The BFCache behavior is aligned with that of the File System Standard ([whatwg/fs#17](https://github.com/whatwg/fs/issues/17)).

## 19. What happens when a document that uses your feature gets disconnected?

The file access operation will terminate, and any pending storage or retrieval will fail gracefully with appropriate errors.

## 20. Does your spec define when and how new kinds of errors should be raised?

No.

## 21. Does your feature allow sites to learn about the user's use of assistive technology?

No.

## 22. What should this questionnaire have asked?

It could include a question about whether the API promotes transparency in user-facing permission prompts to enhance user understanding of the implications of granting access.
