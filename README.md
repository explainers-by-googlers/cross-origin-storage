This proposal outlines the design of the **Cross-Origin Storage (COS)** API, which allows web applications to store and retrieve files across different web origins with explicit user consent. Using concepts introduced in **File System Living Standard** defined by the WHATWG, the COS API facilitates secure cross-origin file storage and retrieval for large files, such as AI models, SQLite databases, offline storage archive files, and shared WebAssembly (Wasm) modules. Taking inpiration from **Cache Digests for HTTP/2**, the API uses file hashes for integrity, while human-readable names allow for permission management.

## Introduction

The **Cross-Origin Storage (COS)** API provides a cross-origin file storage and retrieval mechanism for web applications. It allows applications to store and access large files, such as AI models, SQLite databases, offline storage archives, and shared WebAssembly (Wasm) modules across domains securely and with user consent. Taking inspiration from **Cache Digests for HTTP/2**, files are identified by their hashes, ensuring consistency, and a human-readable name needs to assigned to files for permission management. The API uses concepts like `FileSystemHandle` from the **File System Living Standard** with a focus on cross-origin usage.

```js
const hash = 'SHA-256: 8f434346648f6b96df89dda901c5176b10a6d83961dd3c1ac88b59b2dc327aa4';
const humanReadableName = 'Large AI Model';

// This triggers a permission prompt:
// example.com wants to access the file "Large AI Model" stored in your browser.
// [Allow this time] [Allow on every visit] [Don't allow]
const handle = await navigator.crossOriginStorage.getFileHandle(hash, humanReadableName);

if (handle) {
  // The file exists in Cross-Origin Storage
  const fileBlob = await handle.getFile();
  // Do something with the blob
  console.log('Retrieved', humanReadableName, fileBlob);
}
```

## Risk awareness

> [!CAUTION]
> The authors acknowledge that storage is usually segregated by origin to safeguard user security and privacy. Storing large files like AI models or SQL databases separately for each origin, as demanded by new [use cases](#use-cases), poses a different problem: For instance, if both `example.com` and `example.org` each require the same 8 GB AI model, this would result in a total allocation of 16 GB on the user's device. This proposal centers on effective mechanisms that uphold protection standards while addressing the inefficiencies of duplicated storage.

## Goals

COS aims to:

- Provide a cross-origin storage mechanism for web applications to store and retrieve large files like AI models, SQLite databases, offline storage archives, and Wasm modules.
- Ensure security and user control with explicit consent before accessing or storing files.
- Use SHA-256 (see [Appendix B](#appendix-b-blob-hash-with-the-web-crypto-api)) hashes for file identification, guaranteeing data integrity and consistency.
- Require developers to assign human-readable names to files for permission management.

## Non-goals

COS does not aim to:

- Replace existing storage solutions such as the **Origin Private File System**, the **Cache API**, **IndexedDB**, or **localStorage**.
- Replace content delivery networks (CDNs). The assumption is that the required prompting will discourage websites from using the COS API unless it really makes sense to have resources available cross-origin, such as when they can benefit from using a possibly cached version instead of downloading a new one.
- Provide backend or cloud storage solutions.
- Allow cross-origin file access _without_ explicit user consent.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> COS has distinct objectives from the [Shared Storage API](https://github.com/WICG/shared-storage) proposal, which serves as common infrastructure for privacy preserving cross-site use cases.

## User research

Feedback from developers working with large AI models, datasets, and WebAssembly modules has highlighted the need for an efficient way to store and retrieve such large files across web applications. These developers are looking for a standardized solution that allows files to be stored once and accessed by multiple applications, without needing to re-upload or re-compile the files repeatedly. COS ensures this is possible while maintaining privacy and security via user consent.

## Use cases

### Use case 1: Large AI models

Developers working with large AI models can store these models once and access them across multiple web applications. By using the COS API, the model can be stored under its hash and retrieved with user consent, minimizing repeated uploads and ensuring file integrity. An example is Google's [Gemma 2](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2-2b/tree/main) model [`g-2b-it-gpu-int4.bin'` (1.35 GB)](https://storage.googleapis.com/jmstore/kaggleweb/grader/g-2b-it-gpu-int4.bin'). Another example is the [`Llama-3-70B-Instruct-q3f16_1-MLC` (33.00 GB)](https://huggingface.co/mlc-ai/Llama-3-70B-Instruct-q3f16_1-MLC/tree/main) model.

### Use case 2: Large database files and offline storage archive files

Web applications may depend on large SQLite databases, for example, for geodata as provided by Geocode Earth [`whosonfirst-data-admin-latest.db.bz2` (8.00 GB)](https://geocode.earth/data/whosonfirst/combined/). Another use case is large archive files, for example, [ZIM files](https://wiki.openzim.org/wiki/ZIM_file_format) like [`wikipedia_en_all_maxi_2024-01.zim` (109.89 GB)](https://library.kiwix.org/#lang=eng&category=wikipedia) as used by PWAs like [Kiwix](https://pwa.kiwix.org/www/index.html). Storing such files once in the COS API has the advantage that multiple web apps can share the same resources.

### Use case 3: Big shared Wasm modules

Web applications that utilize large WebAssembly modules can store these modules using COS and share them across applications. This enables efficient sharing of resources between applications, reducing redundant downloading and improving performance. Examples are Kotlin Multiplatform's bindings to Skia [`skiko.wasm` (3.2 MB)](https://github.com/JetBrains/skiko) or Flutter's [`skwasm.wasm` (1.1 MB)](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/renderers#skwasm).

## Potential solution

### File Storage Process

The **COS** API will be available through `navigator.crossOriginStorage`. Files will be stored and retrieved using their hashes, ensuring that each file is uniquely identified. A human-readable needs to be provided for permission management of files.

#### Storing a file

1. The contents of the file will be hashed using SHA-256 (or an equivalent secure algorithm, see [Appendix B](#appendix-b-blob-hash-with-the-web-crypto-api)). The used algorithm will be communicated in the hash as a valid [`HashAlgorithmIdentifier`](https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/#dom-hashalgorithmidentifier), separated by a colon and the actual hash.
2. A handle for the file will be requested, specifying the file's hash and a human-readable name.
3. A permission prompt will be displayed to the user, asking if it's okay to store the file with the provided human-readable name.
4. If a file with the hash already exists, return.
5. Else, upon user consent, the file will be stored by the browser.

```js
// Example usage to store a file
const hash = 'SHA-256: 8f434346648f6b96df89dda901c5176b10a6d83961dd3c1ac88b59b2dc327aa4'; // Assume the file is already identified with a hash
const humanReadableName = 'Large AI model';

// This triggers a permission prompt:
// example.com wants to access the file "Large AI Model" stored by your browser.
// [Allow this time] [Allow on every visit] [Don't allow]
let handle = await navigator.crossOriginStorage.getFileHandle(hash, humanReadableName);

if (!handle) {
  // This triggers a permission prompt:
  // example.com wants to store the file "Large AI Model" in your browser.
  // [Allow] [Don't allow]
  handle = await navigator.crossOriginStorage.getFileHandle(hash, humanReadableName, { create: true });

  // Granted the user's permission, store the file
  const writableStream = await handle.createWritable();
  await writableStream.write(fileBlob);  // Assuming the blob is available
  await writableStream.close();  // Close the writable stream properly after writing
}
```

This will prompt the user to confirm the storage, displaying the human-readable name.

#### Retrieving a file

1. The application will request a file handle using the file's hash.
2. A permission prompt will appear, showing the file's human-readable name.
3. After user consent, the file will be retrieved.

```js
// The known hash of the file and the human-readable name
const hash = 'SHA-256: 8f434346648f6b96df89dda901c5176b10a6d83961dd3c1ac88b59b2dc327aa4';
const humanReadableName = 'Large AI model';

// This triggers a permission prompt:
// example.com wants to access the file "Large AI Model" stored in your browser.
// [Allow this time] [Allow on every visit] [Don't allow]
let handle = await navigator.crossOriginStorage.getFileHandle(hash, humanReadableName);

// If the file already exists, get it from COS
if (handle) {
  // Request user permission and retrieve the file
  const fileBlob = await handle.getFile();
  console.log(`Retrieved file: ${humanReadableName}`);

  // Return the file as a Blob
  console.log(fileBlob);  // This will return the Blob object
} else {
  // Obtain the the file from the network
  const fileBlob = await fetch('https://example.com/ai-model.bin').then(response => response.blob());
  // Return the file as a Blob
  console.log(fileBlob);  // This will return the Blob object
}
```

#### Storing and retrieving a file across unrelated pages

To illustrate the capabilities of the COS API, consider the following example where two unrelated pages want to interact with the same large language model. The first page stores the model in COS, while the second page retrieves it, each using different human-readable names in English and Spanish.

##### Page 1: Storing a large language model with an English Name

On the first page, a web application stores a large language model in COS with a human-readable English name, "Large AI Model."

```js
// The known hash of the file and the human-readable name
const hash = 'SHA-256: 8f434346648f6b96df89dda901c5176b10a6d83961dd3c1ac88b59b2dc327aa4';
const humanReadableName = 'Large AI model';

// Check if the file already exists
// This triggers a permission prompt:
// example.com wants to access the file "Large AI Model" stored in your browser.
// [Allow this time] [Allow on every visit] [Don't allow]
let handle = await navigator.crossOriginStorage.getFileHandle(hash, humanReadableName);

if (handle) {
  // Use the file and return
  // …
  return;
}

// The file doesn't exist, so fetch it from the network
const fileBlob = await fetch('https://example.com/large-ai-model.bin').then(response => response.blob());
const controlHash = await getBlobHash(fileBlob); // Compute the control hash using the method in Appendix B

// Check if control hash and known hash are the same
if (controlHash !== hash) {
  // Downloaded file and wanted file are different
  // …
  return;
}

// This triggers a permission prompt:
// example.com wants to store the file "Large AI Model" in your browser.
// [Allow] [Don't allow]
const humanReadableName = 'Large AI Model';
handle = await navigator.crossOriginStorage.getFileHandle(hash, humanReadableName, { create: true });

// Granted the user's permission, store the file
const writableStream = await handle.createWritable();
await writableStream.write(fileBlob);
await writableStream.close();

console.log(`File stored with name: ${humanReadableName}`);
```

##### Page 2: Retrieving the same model with a Spanish name

On the second, entirely unrelated page, a different web application retrieves the same model from COS but refers to it with a human-readable Spanish name, "Modelo de IA Grande."

```js
// The known hash of the file and the human-readable name
const hash = 'SHA-256: 8f434346648f6b96df89dda901c5176b10a6d83961dd3c1ac88b59b2dc327aa4';
const humanReadableName = 'Modelo de IA Grande';

// Check if the file already exists
// This triggers a permission prompt:
// example.com wants to access the file "Modelo de IA Grande" stored in your browser.
// [Allow this time] [Allow on every visit] [Don't allow]
let handle = await navigator.crossOriginStorage.getFileHandle(hash, humanReadableName);

if (handle) {
  // Request user permission and retrieve the file
  const fileBlob = await handle.getFile();
  // This now logs the Spanish name, even if the file was stored with an English name by page 1
  console.log(`File retrieved with name: ${humanReadableName}`);

  // Use the fileBlob as needed
} else {
  console.error('File not found in COS.');
}
```

##### Key points

- **Unrelated pages:** The two pages belong to different origins and do not share any context, ensuring the example demonstrates cross-origin capabilities.
- **Human-readable names:** Each page assigns its own human-readable name, localized to the user's context. The COS API associates these names with the file's hash, not with the file contents.
- **Cross-origin sharing:** Despite the different names and origins, the file is securely shared via its hash, demonstrating the APl's ability to facilitate cross-origin file storage and retrieval.

## Detailed design discussion

### User consent and permissions

The permission prompt must clearly display the file's name to ensure users understand what file they are being asked to store or retrieve. The goal is to strike a balance between providing sufficient technical details and maintaining user-friendly simplicity.

An **access permission** will be shown every time the `navigator.crossOriginStorage.getFileHandle(hash, humanReadableName)` method is called with two arguments, which can happen to check for existence of the file and to obtain the handle to then get the actual file. The `humanReadableName` will be part of the permission text. User-agents can decide to allow this on every visit, or to explicitly ask upon each access attempt.

```
example.com wants to access the file "large file" stored in your browser.
[Allow this time] [Allow on every visit] [Don't allow]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The permission could mention other recent origins that have accessed the same resource, but this may be misinterpreted by the user as information the current site may learn, which is never the case. Instead, the vision is that user agents would make information about origins that have (recently) accessed a file stored in COS available in special browser settings UI, as outlined in [Handling of eviction](#handling-of-eviction).

A **storage permission** will be shown every time the `navigator.crossOriginStorage.getFileHandle(hash, humanReadableName, { create: true })` method is called with three arguments and the `create` option set to `true`, which is required to store a file by first obtaining the handle to then write to it. The `humanReadableName` will be part of the permission text. User-agents need to explicitly ask upon each storage attempt.

```
example.com wants to store the file "large file" in your browser.
[Allow] [Don't allow]
```

### Privacy

Since the file is stored and retrieved upon explicit user permission, there's no way for files stored in COS to become supercookies without raising the user's suspicion. Privacy-sensitive user agents can decide to prompt upon every retrieval operation, others can decide to only prompt once, and auto-allow from thereon. In contrast, storing a file in COS always requires the user's permission.

### Hashing

COS relies on the same hashing algorithm to be used for all resources. It's not possible to mix hashing algorithms, since, without access to the original file, there's no way to verify if a hash generated with hashing algorithm A corresponds to a hash generated with hashing algorithm B. The used hashing algorithm is encoded in the hash as a [`HashAlgorithmIdentifier`](https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/#dom-hashalgorithmidentifier), separated by a colon and the actual hash.

```
SHA-256: 8f434346648f6b96df89dda901c5176b10a6d83961dd3c1ac88b59b2dc327aa4
```

The current hashing algorithm is [SHA-256](https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/#alg-sha-256), implemented by the **Web Crypto API**.

## Open questions

### Concurrency

What should happen if two tabs depend on the same resource, check COS, see it's not there, and start downloading? Should this be handled smartly? How often does this happen in practice? In the worst case, the file gets downloaded twice, but would then still only be stored once.

### Minimum resource size

Should there be a required minimum resource size for a resource to be eligible for COS? Most likely not, since it would be trivial to inflate the file size of non-qualifying resources by adding space characters or comments. The assumption is that the required prompting would be scary enough for websites to only use COS for resources where it really makes sense to have them available cross-origin, that is, where they could profit themselves from using a potentially already cached version rather than downloading their own version from the network.

### Handling of eviction

Browsers should likely treat resources in COS under the same conditions as if they were [`persist()`](https://storage.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-storagemanager-persist)ed as per the Storage Living Standard.

User agents are envisioned to offer browser settings UI for the user to see what resources are stored in COS and what origins recently have used each resource. Based on this stored information about the origins having last used a resource, the UI would let the user decide to delete a resource from COS.

Under critical storage pressure, user agents could offer a manual dialog that invites the user to manually free up storage.

### Out-of-bounds access

If a user already has manually downloaded a resource like a large AI model, should the browser offer a way to let the user put the resource in COS? Most likely this doesn't even need specifying, but could just be an affordance provided by the user-agent.

## Considered alternatives

### Storing files without hashing

Storing files by their names rather than using hashes would risk collisions and lead to inconsistent access, especially in a cross-origin environment. The use of hashes guarantees unique identification of each file, ensuring that the contents are consistently recognized and retrieved.

### Manually opening files from harddisk

Different origins can manually open the same file on disk, either using the File System Access API's `showOpenFilePicker()` method or using the classic `<input type="file">` approach. This requires the file to be stored once, but access to the file can then be shared as explained in [Cache AI models in the browser](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/cache-models#special_case_use_a_model_on_a_hard_disk). While this works, it's manual and error-prone, as it requires the user to know what file to choose from their harddisk in the picker.

### Integrating cross-origin stoage in the `fetch()` API

On the server, cross-origin isolation isn't really a problem. At the same time, server runtimes like Node.js, Bun, or Deno implement `fetch()` as well. To avoid fragmentation and to keep the present `fetch()` API simple, it probably doesn't make sense to add COS to it.

### Integrating cross-origin storage in the Cache API

The Cache API is fundamentally modeled around the concepts of `Request` or URL strings, and `Response`, for example, `Cache.match()` or `Cache.put()`. In contrast, what makes COS unique is that it uses file hashes as the keys to files to avoid duplicates.

### Solving the problem only for AI models

AI models are admittedly the biggest motivation for working on COS, so one alternative would be to solve the problem exclusively for AI models, for example, by offering a storage mechanism on the `self.ai.*` namespace that Chrome is experimenting with in the context of built-in AI APIs like the [Prompt API](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/prompt-api) proposal. Two questions arise in the context: First, how would it be enforced that files are really AI models? Second, `self.ai.*` is explicitly focused on built-in AI APIs where the model is provided by the browser and not by the developer. Given this background, this approach doesn't seem like a great fit, and, maybe more importantly, the other use cases are well worth solving, too.

### Appendix C: FAQ

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>Q:</strong> Does this API help with resuming downloads? What if downloading a big resource fails before the file ends up in COS?
  </summary>
  <p>
    <strong>A:</strong> Managing downloads is out of scope for this proposal. COS can work with complete or with sharded files that the developer stores in COS as separate blobs and then assembles them after retrieval from COS. This way, downloads can be handled completely out-of-bounds, and developers can, for example, leverage the <a href="https://wicg.github.io/background-fetch/">Background Fetch API</a> or regular <code>fetch()</code> requests with <code>Range</code> headers to download large resources.
